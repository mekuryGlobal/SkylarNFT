We build skylar with unity engage using C# language. We utilized IPFS to tokenize our game.
We created a multiple chain dialogue system by creating an NPC file archive for out players to interact with teachers. 
We have an interactive system that students communicate with when the encounter game objects that will initiate missions.
We created models of educational contents like cells, human body parts and planets in 3Dmax

The player solves puzzle and interacts with 3D models to learn.
